Need an option to pause sync.  
In overflow menu, once user is logged in, 'Pause / Play Sync' toggle option should be available. "Use Pause/Play icon + Sync" as label.  This has to be available in all screens


can't we have a reusable capability for overflow menu fuctions that get attached with every screen.  Why should all screens get modified to include a overflow menu option.  Insted it should be a reuse object consolidating all such central menu items and then that module getting called from all screens.  right?
