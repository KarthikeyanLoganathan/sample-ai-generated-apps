help me prepare statistics sheet.  It should employ excel formulas to give ROW count on each of the data sheets for sheets of tables of TABLE_DEFINITIONS.

statistics sheet format:
Sheet | Records
currencies: 1

Create sheet if one does not exist.  
Update sheet with headers rows, column formulas when a sheet already exists
