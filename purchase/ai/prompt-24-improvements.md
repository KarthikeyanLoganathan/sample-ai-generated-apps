when user is not logged in, Sync with Google Sheets option should be disabled.

In Home Screen sync now popup should not show up.


When I come back from UnitDetailScreen, Units screen is not refreshing.


Sync does not push units
Sync does not push currencies

When I logout, warn if sync is pending.  after database has to be cleard.

When I logout clear local data


during logout are you also clearing condensed_change_log



When application starts without a login, we have a welcome dialog

Welcome! Would you like to download data from Google Sheets now? This will sync all data. Later "Sync Now"

Let us do away with this.

When Lauching Home screen, the following should happen.
- User is not logged in already.  Provide two options to the user.
  - Login option.   OR
  - Import Sample Data

- In the CommonOverFlowMenu, provide option to Login (if user is not already logged in)
