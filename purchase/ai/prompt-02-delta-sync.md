I need capability to sync up this data with Google Sheet, having sheets in google sheet identical to the SQLite database.  Either Google Sheet API or Google Apps Script can be used for the sync.

The updated at timestamp should be updated automatically on insert and update.  This should serve as the basis for sync up with Google Sheet.
